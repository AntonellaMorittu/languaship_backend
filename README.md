 Final Project - January 2018 Cohort
 
 Languaship - _Language learning by exchange_

## Description
Week 11 and 12 Project of Craft Academy cohort January 2018.

LANGUASHIP is a Mobile App created applying the method of Language Tandem based on mutual language exchange between tandem partners (ideally each learner is a native speaker in the language the proponent wants to learn). 
With this App users can get in contact based on the language they can teach and the one they want to learn, their location,  preferred age and gender of the language partner they wish to meet.

You can view the app downloading Ionic View and using the code ....
